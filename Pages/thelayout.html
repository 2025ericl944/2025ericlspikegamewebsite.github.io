<h1 class="center">The Menu</h1>
<p class="center">There are only 4 buttons, the logo, and the fancy background here. The Play Button starts the game, the Save Button saves the game, the Load Button loads the save, and the "MOAR GAMES" Button brings you to my <a href="https://2025ericl944.github.io/2025ericlintrogame.github.io/">first game's website</a>. The "PlaceHolder" text displays the High Score when you boot up the game.</p> 
<h1 class="center">The Game</h1>
<p class="center">The main game(what you can see) is confined to a tiny box, inside of it containing a background cave, the health meter, some placeholder text, the ground, and the player. The Health Meter fills up upon starting the game, and the large placeholder text displays the current score, while the small placeholder text displays the high score. The ground and background are there for cosmetics, and the player is the small blue cube that is definitely not familiar. Slightly outside of the layout are an explosion, some powerups, and the blue bar. The blue bar is there to destroy things once they exit the layout to save memory. The powerups will spawn 100 feet in the air but for now they're down here to help determine the correct sizes. The explosion is also there to help determine sizes. Way above the layout are a Health power-up, a spike, and an insta-kill spike. They are way above the layout to sort of get the player used to each of them before they show up.</p>
