<p class="center">You, a cube who you have definitely never seen before, are performing work within an anomalous cave in [REDACTED], Chile. The organization you work for is the WHO, or the Worldwide Health Organization. This cave is always at a steady 29 degrees Fahrenheit or -1.6 degrees celsius no matter what you try to do to change its' temperature, and often tries to "accidentally" kill anyone who enters, all the way from slipping on ice to falling stalagtites to boulders rolling down the hills. The WHO is attempting to do research on the anomalous nature of the cave and has recruited you to keep their researchers safe. Your duties in the cave are to apply salt to the ground to prevent slipping. While you are working in the totally safe working conditions, your friend codenamed "Bob" is performing his daily stalagtite removal routine. As you apply salt on the ground below, stalagtites fall from the ceiling as Bob rapidly drills them using his high-precision sawblade. You weren't provided with a mining helmet yet, so try to stay alive as long as you can!</p> 
<h1 class="center">How to Play</h1>
<p class="center">If on mobile, hold on the screen with your finger to get the small blue cube on the screen to move. If on a computer, click and hold on the screen. Dodge and weave between and around the falling stalagtites to not get hit. Simply touching a spike can deal damage. You start with 3 HP, and each normal spike deals 1 damage. Later on, there will be red and black spikes. These are instakill, so stay away from them. As time goes on, the speed of the falling projectiles will increase, just to challenge the player a bit. As you play, power-ups(and power-downs) will begin to fall. Feel free to catch them to see what they do. Now for the score. For every spike that you manage to dodge, you get 75 points, unless you get the x2 powerup, and in that case each spike grants 150. The goal of the game is to survive and accumulate as many points as you can. There is a display of your high score both on the menu and in the game itself. You can feel free to save and load your save on the menu to keep track of progress. Have fun!</p>
